I will revamp the e-commerce experience to match the modern, minimalist aesthetic of the reference images (Uber Eats, Apple, Nike). The focus will be on a cleaner layout, better product visualization, and improved navigation.

### **Phase 1: Layout Architecture (Desktop & Mobile)**
- **Desktop Sidebar Navigation (Nike/Warby Parker style)**: 
  - Move category filtering from the top bar to a dedicated **Left Sidebar**.
  - This allows for scalable filtering (Categories, Price/Points Range, Tags) without cluttering the header.
  - The layout will shift to a `Grid` structure: `[Sidebar 250px] [Product Grid flexible]`.
- **Mobile Experience (Uber Eats style)**:
  - Keep the horizontal scroll for categories but redesign them as **"Pill" or "Circle" navigation** (more space-efficient than large cards).
  - Use a sticky "Filter" bar for easy access to sort/refine options.

### **Phase 2: "Premium" Product Card Redesign**
- **Visual Style**:
  - **Remove borders/shadows**: Move to a "Clean" aesthetic where the image sits on a subtle gray/white background, with text aligned below (Apple/Nike style).
  - **Aspect Ratio**: Standardize images to a professional aspect ratio (e.g., 1:1 or 4:5).
  - **Interactivity**:
    - **Desktop**: Show "Quick Add" button and secondary image on hover.
    - **Mobile**: specialized "Add" button optimized for touch.
  - **Typography**: clearer hierarchy—Product Name (Bold/Medium) > Description (Subtle) > Points/Price (Accent Color).
- **Badges**: Redesign "New", "Best Seller", "Low Stock" badges to be minimalist and elegant.

### **Phase 3: Refined Hero & Category Sections**
- **Immersive Hero**: Update `PageHero` to be cleaner, possibly full-width with better typography alignment.
- **Category Highlights**:
  - Replace the current large `CategoryCard` grid at the top with a more subtle "Featured Collections" section or integrate them into the sidebar/home view.

### **Implementation Steps**
1.  **Create `ProductCardModern.tsx`**: A new, highly visual component replacing the current `Card` based implementation.
2.  **Refactor `ProductsClient.tsx`**: 
    -   Implement the **Sidebar Layout** using a grid system.
    -   Add collapsible sections for "Categories" and "Tags".
    -   Integrate the new `ProductCardModern`.
3.  **Style Refinements**: Update typography and spacing tokens to match the "airy" feel of the references.

**Outcome**: A professional, "store-like" feel that trusts the product imagery to do the selling, reducing UI clutter.
