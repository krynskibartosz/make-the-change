The user wants to leverage another AI agent (which *does* have the Supabase MCP) to generate the correct types, rather than having me manually guess and patch them. This is a very smart move to ensure 100% accuracy.

My role now is to craft a precise prompt for that other agent. The prompt must:
1.  Explain the context: We are fixing TypeScript errors in a Next.js monorepo (`web-client` app).
2.  Identify the problem: The `database.types.ts` file is missing specific views/tables that are being used in the code.
3.  List the missing entities: `public_producers`, `public_products`, `public_featured_projects`, `public_projects`, `blog_posts`.
4.  Specify the output format: We need the updated `packages/core/src/shared/db/database.types.ts` file content.

I will write this prompt and present it to the user.

**Plan:**
1.  Construct the prompt listing all the missing views identified in my error logs.
2.  Provide the path to the file that needs updating.
3.  Ask the user to copy-paste this prompt to the other agent.

I don't need to perform any more code edits myself right now. I will just output the prompt.

**Missing Entities to include in the prompt:**
- `public_projects` (I added it manually, but better to have the real one)
- `public_producers`
- `public_products`
- `public_featured_projects`
- `blog_posts`
- `public_user_rankings` (Verify columns)

I will present this plan to exit plan mode, and then the final response will be the prompt itself.
