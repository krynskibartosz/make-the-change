I have successfully repaired the fundamental type definitions, but the validation (`npm run type-check`) revealed a critical secondary issue: **TypeScript is still inferring the client type as `never` in many places**, likely because of how `createClient` is being imported or used in server components vs client components.

### Analysis of Remaining Errors
- **Error Count**: 197 errors (down from potential thousands, but still blocking).
- **Core Issue**: `Property '...' does not exist on type 'never'`. This confirms that despite my fix to `apps/web-client/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, the usage in pages (like `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/investments/page.tsx`) is not picking up the generic type correctly, or there are other helper functions returning `never`.

### Refined Plan to Eliminate All Errors
1.  **Strictly Type the Client Helper**: I will revisit `apps/web-client/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` to ensure it explicitly returns `Promise<SupabaseClient<Database>>`.
2.  **Fix Component Imports**: I will check if components are importing `createClient` from the right place.
3.  **Address "Property does not exist" Errors**:
    - Many errors are simple property access on `profile` or `project` objects that TypeScript thinks are `never`. Once the client is typed, these should resolve.
    - If some persist (e.g., `public_projects` properties I might have missed like `location`), I will update `database.types.ts` again.
4.  **Fix RPC Calls**: Errors in `place_euro_order` and `place_points_order` suggest the RPC function signatures in `database.types.ts` might be missing or incorrect. I will check and add them if needed.

I will start by reinforcing the `createClient` definition to be bulletproof.

Shall I proceed with this final cleanup pass?
