# Memory Workflow (Codex)

## Daily Session Pattern
1. Create a new file in `.codex/memory/sessions/` from `SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Keep `MEMORY_INDEX.md` updated with current mission, latest session, and open risks.
3. Move stable architecture/security decisions into `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Weekly Pattern Extraction
1. Review the last 5 session files.
2. Promote repeated solutions into stable decisions (ADR/invariants).
3. Archive stale tracks and keep only active priorities in `MEMORY_INDEX.md`.

## Session Filename Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`
